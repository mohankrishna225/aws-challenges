<p>Project Idea:</p>
<p>The way you treat your employees is the way they treat your customers. According to a recent article, creating an employee recognition culture can increase employee retention by up to 31%. Employee recognition is the process of showing appreciation for an employeeâ€™s achievements, actions, and contributions. In some of the top companies, appreciation is given to the employees based on the customer feedback or satisfaction(chat process/ voice process). Analyzing all the feedback of each customer towards an employee contribution toward the work manually is a tedious job. so there should be a process that will analyze the best employee based on customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Solution Requirements:</p>
<p>The main objective of this project is to appreciate the employee work based on analysis of customer feedback. Design an application, where the HR/ User can upload the feedback report of all the employees. The appreciation analysis of each employee displayed on the Web application in the form of Bar charts.</p>
