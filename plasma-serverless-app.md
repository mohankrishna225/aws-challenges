<h5 id="project-description">Project Description</h5>
<p>Project Idea:</p>
<p>The main objective of this project is to provide the recipient with a donor who is in good form with no health ailments to donate blood of the corresponding blood group. This project provides quick access to donors for an immediate requirement of blood. In case of an emergency/surgery, blood procurement is always a major problem which consumes a lot of time. This helps serve the major time-lapse in which a life can be saved!</p>
<p>Solution Requirement:</p>
<p>To build a web application that is capable of acting as a medium for recipients and donors of blood. The application must be deployed on Elastic Beanstalk. Create an API Endpoint for the model with the help of API Gateway and AWS Lambda Service. An alert is to be sent using the Simple Notification Service to all the registered users whenever a request for blood is posted.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Recipient:  The one who has a requirement of blood can register for the first time and then log in from the next for any requirement of blood. He/She can provide the recipientâ€™s details such as the blood group, sex and age, and the minimum time for donation so that the admin as well as the donors can view and act accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donor:  The one who wants to donate blood can register and login to the site and check for any updates on requirements. If they wish to donate they can get into contact with the recipient and proceed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Proposed Technical Architecture:</p>
