<h5 id="project-description">Project Description</h5>
<p>Project Idea:</p>
<p>The main objective of this project is to get information regarding doctors available in a city in various departments. This application will give a list that contains several departments. Upon selecting a department, the site will direct the user giving details about various doctors available in that department along with the hospital in which they are available at respective times. The user will also have a facility to read the reviews given by the people who had already consulted the same doctor. If he feels comfortable with the doctor there will be an option to book an appointment.</p>
<p>The hospital management needs to register into this application to get notifications regarding the appointments made online. Upon Registration, by using their login id and password they can log in into the application and show the availability of the doctor from time to time. People using this application need not do any login actions. They can just select their department and proceed with further process.</p>
<p>Solution Requirement:</p>
<p>Develop an end to end application capable of sending notifications regarding the appointment made through online. The doctor details of various departments must be stored in DynamoDB and the user-health records are stored in Amazon S3. Create an API Endpoint for the model with the help of API Gateway and AWS Lambda Service. Web Application must be deployed on Elastic BeanStalk and Fast2SMS service must be used to send alerts regarding the alerts.</p>
<p>Proposed Technical Architecture:</p>
